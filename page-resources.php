                        Book your removal dates at least 2 weeks before your removal date — do this in writing !
                        accept the quotation and get written confirmation that your removal team has been booked.​​
                        Moving home is a high risk time and it is strongly recommended that you insure all goods to
                        be moved or stored. – Do this through your own insurer or ask your Removals consultant to
                        assist you in this regard.​​ Do clear out your home and dispose of any unwanted items – dump /
                        sell or donate unwanted
                        items – there are many welfare organisations that will gladly accept donated items.​​

                        Double check the following ** That your move dates are booked ** That you
                        have signed and submitted your acceptance forms. Be comfortable that you have insured your
                        goods during transit. If you are attending to your own packing you need to be well on your
                        way to having packed everything.​​

                        <span class="boldText">3 Days to go</span>
                        Advise your mover what Items still need to be packed – Most reputable removal
                        companies are easily able to assist you with packing of smalls / breakables / glass tops /
                        TV sets and fragiles like pictures and lamps.​​

                        Make sure that these are moved and out of the way on move days – animals are
                        especially at risk of being traumatised and they need to be safely kenneled or out of the
                        way.​​

                        Keys / Cell phones / Plane tickets / Firearms / Wallets / Valuables and travel bags / Goods
                        not to be moved – Make sure that these are kept safe and are not left lying around – It is a
                        good Idea to designate a room and to keep these items separate and safely locked up.​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make sure that you have paid for your removal or ensure that you have internet access to
                        make a transaction. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make sure that all goods that need to be moved are taken – take a tour of the home and
                        property to ensure that everything is taken. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Do keep a kettle some coffee/ milk and sugar and refreshments available so that you can take
                        a break during the move. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is also a very good idea to have a ” bits box ” keep TV remotes , bed screws and bolts ,
                        a few tools , some cleaning materials , Packing tape and a knife and anything else that you
                        may need to retain and use at a moments notice. ​
