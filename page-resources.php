            <p>
                Book your removal dates at least 2 weeks before your removal date — do this in writing !
                accept the quotation and get written confirmation that your removal team has been booked.​​
                Moving home is a high risk time and it is strongly recommended that you insure all goods to
                be moved or stored. – Do this through your own insurer or ask your Removals consultant to
                assist you in this regard.​​ Do clear out your home and dispose of any unwanted items – dump /
                sell or donate unwanted
                items – there are many welfare organisations that will gladly accept donated items.​​
                <br>
                <br />
                <span class="boldText">5 Days to go</span>
                Double check the following ** That your move dates are booked ** That you
                have signed and submitted your acceptance forms. Be comfortable that you have insured your
                goods during transit. If you are attending to your own packing you need to be well on your
                way to having packed everything.​​
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="boldText">3 Days to go</span>
                Advise your mover what Items still need to be packed – Most reputable removal
                companies are easily able to assist you with packing of smalls / breakables / glass tops /
                TV sets and fragiles like pictures and lamps.​​
                <br>
                <br>
                <span class="boldText">Pets / Cars</span>
                Make sure that these are moved and out of the way on move days – animals are
                especially at risk of being traumatised and they need to be safely kenneled or out of the
                way.​​
                <br>
                <br>
                Keys / Cell phones / Plane tickets / Firearms / Wallets / Valuables and travel bags / Goods
                not to be moved – Make sure that these are kept safe and are not left lying around – It is a
                good Idea to designate a room and to keep these items separate and safely locked up.​
                <br>
                <br>
                Make sure that you have paid for your removal or ensure that you have internet access to
                make a transaction. ​
                <br>
                <br>
                Make sure that all goods that need to be moved are taken – take a tour of the home and
                property to ensure that everything is taken. ​
                <br>
                <br>
                Do keep a kettle some coffee/ milk and sugar and refreshments available so that you can take
                a break during the move. ​
                <br>
                <br>
                It is also a very good idea to have a ” bits box ” keep TV remotes , bed screws and bolts ,
                a few tools , some cleaning materials , Packing tape and a knife and anything else that you
                may need to retain and use at a moments notice. ​

                Contact a professional removal company at least one month before your relocation.<br />

                1. Access at both premises for large vehicles. How many floors/ sections are being moved.<br />
                2. The time frame and duration that your company has available for the relocation. The packing
                and removal dates that you have in mind.<br />

                8. Building specific health and safety requirements (such as PPE or other safety items).

                and planning for the removal is realistic and efficient!<br /><br />

                <span class="boldText">Internal office moving strategies</span>

                While your consultant will assist you in ironing out a lot of the folds around the process of office
                removals, we have provided you with a couple of strategies and ideas that you can follow to make the
                process easier:<br />
                1. Have floor plans of both sites readily available for planning.<br />
                2. Make use of clearly marked labels and colour coded stickers to distinguish between
                departments and floors, by marking items to correspond with the clearly marked rooms at the
                new premises, you will save a lot of time and effort during the relocation.<br />
                3. Designate a “lost and found” section at the new premises for any items that may arrive
                unmarked.<br />
                4. Provide staff with a box allowance and ensure that they are packed up well in advance. Ensure
                that you leave enough “down time” for dismantling and reassembly.<br />
                5. Should you have unused documents, consider offsite storage, ask your removal company to
                assist.<br />
                6. Pre order packing material.<br />
                7. Have your removal consultant provide you with packing tips for your employees, this will ensure
                that boxes are packed correctly.<br />
                8. Ask the removal company to include an after service remedial team in their quotation, this will
                allow you to have assistance in moving around any items that may not fit into their new spot as
                planned after the relocation has taken place!<br /><br />

                Communication is key to a successful office removal, by planning out an effective strategy, you will
                ensure that your removal takes place as seamlessly as possible.

                    <p>
                        Book your removal dates at least 2 weeks before your removal date — do this in writing !
                        accept the quotation and get written confirmation that your removal team has been booked.​​
                        Moving home is a high risk time and it is strongly recommended that you insure all goods to
                        be moved or stored. – Do this through your own insurer or ask your Removals consultant to
                        assist you in this regard.​​ Do clear out your home and dispose of any unwanted items – dump /
                        sell or donate unwanted
                        items – there are many welfare organisations that will gladly accept donated items.​​

                        <span class="boldText">5 Days to go</span>
                        Double check the following ** That your move dates are booked ** That you
                        have signed and submitted your acceptance forms. Be comfortable that you have insured your
                        goods during transit. If you are attending to your own packing you need to be well on your
                        way to having packed everything.​​

                        <span class="boldText">3 Days to go</span>
                        Advise your mover what Items still need to be packed – Most reputable removal
                        companies are easily able to assist you with packing of smalls / breakables / glass tops /
                        TV sets and fragiles like pictures and lamps.​​

                        Make sure that these are moved and out of the way on move days – animals are
                        especially at risk of being traumatised and they need to be safely kenneled or out of the
                        way.​​

                        Keys / Cell phones / Plane tickets / Firearms / Wallets / Valuables and travel bags / Goods
                        not to be moved – Make sure that these are kept safe and are not left lying around – It is a
                        good Idea to designate a room and to keep these items separate and safely locked up.​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make sure that you have paid for your removal or ensure that you have internet access to
                        make a transaction. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Make sure that all goods that need to be moved are taken – take a tour of the home and
                        property to ensure that everything is taken. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Do keep a kettle some coffee/ milk and sugar and refreshments available so that you can take
                        a break during the move. ​
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        It is also a very good idea to have a ” bits box ” keep TV remotes , bed screws and bolts ,
                        a few tools , some cleaning materials , Packing tape and a knife and anything else that you
                        may need to retain and use at a moments notice. ​
